    <p>
      Swank respects the intellectual property rights of others, and we expect
      you to do the same. Swank's Terms of Service do not allow posting,
      sharing, or sending any content that violates or infringes someone elseâ€™s

    <h2 class="text-blue-500 font-semibold text-xl">What is Copyright?</h2>
    <p>
      Copyright is a legal right that protects original works of authorship
      (e.g., music, videos, etc.). Generally, copyright protects an original
      expression of an idea but does not protect underlying ideas or facts.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-blue-500 font-semibold text-xl">Copyright Infringement</h2>
    <p>
      We do not allow any content that infringes copyright. Any use of
      copyrighted content of others without proper authorization or legally
      valid reason may lead to a violation. In some cases, you may be required
      to provide evidence to prove that you are entitled to use copyrighted
      content of others.
